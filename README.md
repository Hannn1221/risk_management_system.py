📊 Portfolio Risk Management System

A comprehensive Python-based multi-asset portfolio risk management system demonstrating advanced quantitative finance and risk modeling concepts.

🎯 Project Overview

This system simulates and evaluates portfolio risk using multiple industry-standard techniques:

Value at Risk (VaR): Historical, Parametric, Monte Carlo

Expected Shortfall (CVaR): Tail-risk measurement

Backtesting: Kupiec test for model validation

Stress Testing: Historical market crises (COVID-19, 2008 Financial Crisis, Black Monday, etc.)

Risk Attribution: Component VaR & marginal contributions
